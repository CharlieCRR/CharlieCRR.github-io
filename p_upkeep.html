						<br /> <br />
						A Project developed in Year 1 as part of 'Rapid Games Prototyping' module in the Unity Engine, which I intend to pursue development on over the Summer of 2024
						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What is the project?</u></font></b> <!-- Introducing the Project-->
						<br /> Upkeep is a project made for University Coursework, we were originally given a framework for a top-down shooter that we were to develop into a rough prototype for a game. This project in particular
						saw large amounts of completion and the end result I was relatively satisfied with and I intend to continue development into a feature-complete game as opposed to a rough prototype. 
						<br /> <br /> As for what the game is itself, it's a top-down shooter game where you spawn on an island filled with materials that you collect to build up a base to survive the night. The base gets run down throughout
						the night as enemies siege the base but when day breaks you can add onto what remains of your base, I really liked the idea of building upon the ruins of what remains from previous nights and is where the name
						Upkeep derives from. Each night progressively gets harder and harder until the 5th night where you have a showdown with the Necromancer to win the game.


						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What this project taught me</u></font></b> <!-- Skills Learnt -->
						<br /><b>C# Proficiency:</b> Before this project, my C# knowledge was very lacking and working with Unity was something I struggled with. Throughout the development of this project my knowledge in Unity and C#
						was greatly expanded to a point I feel confident with, which allows me to now consider Unity as a potential option for future entries to game jams.
						<br /><br /><b>Game Design Principals:</b> This project gave me invaluable experience in designing a game and making it fun to play, a ton of changes took place throughout development to the originally planned mechanics
						and the game itself to make the game catered towards the player and making it more fun to play. I didn't want the game to feel too restricting and like a chore so attaining feedback and making these changes
						gave me a strong eye for self critique.
