						<br /> <br />
						A community project that I ran over the course of December 2020 and December 2021 for Growing Map <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2314546923" target="_blank">#1</a>
 and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2688493814" target="_blank">#2</a> Respectively.
						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What is the project?</u></font></b> <!-- Introducing the Project-->
						<br /> The Growing Map series were two maps I made for Garry's mod, these maps were then published as empty; being devoid of content. The community would then get together and make suggestions for these maps
						and I would implement them in, and the map would quickly develop over the course of the month into something more.
						<br />These maps got REALLY popular and held front-page on the steam workshop for the majority of the time they were active. There have also been a few inspired spin-offs from the original two maps and they
						have been <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAPtvxSFQSo" target="_blank"> covered by large YouTubers</a></i>	within the Garry's Mod Community.


						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What this project taught me</u></font></b> <!-- Skills Learnt -->
						<br /><b>Working Under Pressure:</b> When these maps peaked in viewership and suggestions, I had to work very swiftly to keep up with the demand. It was not uncommon to wake up to 250+ messages overnight and have to sift through them all.
						<br /><b>Communication:</b> I had to communicate with members of the community to ensure that I got suggestions executed correctly as per request, but also swiftly to keep up with demand.
						<br /><b>Games Design Principals:</b> While this doesn't apply for the first iteration, the second growing map placed suggestions one after another to make a linear story, and it was heavily important that I could
						direct the player without directly holding their hand in puzzles utilising techniques such as lighting. I would also reward the player for exploring areas off to the side and had to tweak the difficulty of
						certain segments to make sure it felt right and fair.
