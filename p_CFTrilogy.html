					<p>
						<br />
						The cF trilogy of game is 3 games based around a company titled 'cF Research Labs', originally started out as a joke, this fictional company became the forefront of the 3 games I collaborated on with my friends for game jams.</a>
						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What was the trilogy?</u></font></b> <!-- Introducing the Project-->
						<br />The 3 games (in order of creation) for the cF trilogy are
						<br /><a href="https://chopper0.itch.io/flight-ds107" target="_blank"> <b> Flight DS-107</b></a>: An endless clicker game about trying to stay alive exploring space, seeing how long you can stay alive.
						<br /><a href="https://chopper0.itch.io/threat-suppressor" target="_blank"> <b> Threat Suppressor</b></a>: A guess-who esc game about trying to find out which VIP is about to be assassinated through intel gathered from phone calls.
						<br /><a href="https://chopper0.itch.io/the-ua01-initiative" target="_blank"> <b> The UA01 Initiative:</b></a>: A simple puzzle clicker game about shapes and colours.


						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What these projects taught me</u></font></b> <!-- Skills Learnt -->
						<br /> These projects taught me a ton about working towards game jams and the deadlines, constraints and creating a game scope thats feasible within the time given.
						<br /> <b> Flight DS-107:</b> <br />
						Flight DS-107 was a big learning experience, being the first in the trilogy. The game was subject to feature creep and not much of the content was planned out in advance which means a ton of things were cut and the final product has bugs.
						The game was created in UE4 in blueprinting, but was primarily on UI on one big master class - which taught me a ton about UI but having everything rely on one class was really tricky to troubleshoot. The game looks really nice
						thanks to my friend who was on the art direction but mechanically the gameplay isn't really intensive and things aren't really explained well which makes the game incredibly overwhelming and this was again, because of feature creep.
						<br /> <b> Threat Suppressor:</b> <br />
						My personal favourite of the trilogy, also made in UE4 Blueprinting. This game was planned ahead of time before production which made things much simpler and it came together nicely in production - a ton of the classes were built with
						flexibility in mind which meant adding onto the already existing system was really easy and dynamic. This is my first game-jam game to have a win condition, and implementing a goal into a game made the game much more enjoyable to play
						as all prior games are endless endurance tests which while okay, having an end goal really made the game feel fulfilling to win. Everything came together nicely in the end and it's a product i'm super pleased with, it taught me a ton about
						marketing the game too, and making an engaging page. In past game jams the marketing side of the game was an afterthought which meant the game sank to the bottom in terms of ratings but this game had a proper powerful engaging page, identity
						and icon.
						<br /> <b> The UA01 Initiative:</b> <br />
						The most recent, this game was made in Unity and was a test of my built-up skills over the academic year at Staffordshire University. The game is very very simple in being you click a shape that matches a prompt, but the theming
						and identity around the game is very strong and this resulted in it being #3 in creativity, while scoring #97 in gameplay. The gameplay wasn't that strong as this was my first rodeo in Unity that wasn't academic, meaning without teacher guiding
						and help. This game proved helpful in teaching me Unity and also working under pressure with actual code as opposed to blueprinting, as all previous games were built entirely on Unreal. However, after working on certain projects like
						Upkeep and this, I'm confident I could give Unity a good go in future game jams.

						<br /> <br /> <b> <font size="+2"><u>My Contributions</u></b></font> <br /> <!-- Project Overview-->
						My Main contributions to the trilogy were as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>I handled the project files solely, my friend would be on the side of creating art and sound for the games and I would implement them</li>
							<li>Building up the games mechanics and troubleshooting them</li>
							<li>Concepting and scoping the game up in relation to the time constraint given</li>
						</ul>
