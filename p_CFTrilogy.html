						A Upcoming game being developed within the Staffordshire Games Department, which I got a chance to work on during the 1UP Scheme. <a href="https://tiga.org/news/the-tiga-games-industry-award-winners-2023-are-revealed" target="_blank"> This project won the 'Best Arcade Game 2023' TIGA Award</a>
						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What was the project?</u></font></b> <!-- Introducing the Project-->
						<br /> <b>(From the Gameplay Teaser) </b> MechHead is a fast-paced round-based arena shooter which pays
						homage to the genres classics. Customise your mech, smash high scoresâ€‹, and unleash carnage to win the favour of the crowd!
						Developed as part of Staffordshire University's 2023 1UP placement scheme, MechHead's development staff consisted of students from all levels of study.

						<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What this project taught me</u></font></b> <!-- Skills Learnt -->
						<br /><b>Teamwork within a Discipline:</b> While on other projects I've worked with different departments, this was my first time having a tech team that was much bigger one. This taught me about communicating within the team to avoid potential
						merge conflicts, helping to create and follow a coding standard set by the tech lead.
						<br /><br /><b>Professional Practices:</b> Throughout the project we maintained a TO-DO board in which we frequently reviewed and assigned tasks, which was especially prominent in our morning stand-up meetings held within the
						tech-team. Working so closely to an actively maintained board is a concept that I was familiar with but to enforce it closely to an industry standard was something new but invaluable to learn.


						<br /> <br /> <b> <font size="+2"><u>My Contributions</u></b></font> <br /> <!-- Project Overview-->
						My Main contributions to this project were as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Working closely with the tech lead to complete vital tasks and keeping the QA-Submitted bug reports down by troubleshooting and fixing</li>
							<li>Building the gun and their respective rarity systems up with flexibility in mind for the design team to edit and build upon the base I had made for them.</li>
							<li>Working closely with design to ensure features programmed were open-ended and could easily be manipulated.</li>
							<li>Whenever I would have no further things I could be working on, I assisted co-workers within the tech-team.</li>
						</ul>
