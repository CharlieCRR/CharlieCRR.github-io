					<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What was the project?</u></font></b> <!-- Introducing the Project-->
					<br /> This project was the final year CIR, which stands for 'Creative Industry Response', we were given an assigned creative task - which was to create a promotional game for the national history museum
					towards the target audience of ages 16-25. We went down the route of archeology abstracted from dinosaurs, which was a theme present on the museum's' website. The full-indepth analysis of the brief and the 
					different various themes presented and why dinosaurs were specifically chosen 
					is over on my <a href="https://c987752925.wixsite.com/charlierrevellgs20/copy-of-artefact-preperation" target=”_blank”>legacy college portfolio site. </a>
					<br /> <br /> <b><font size="+2"><u>What this project taught me</u></font></b> <!-- Skills Learnt -->
					<br /><b>Teamwork:</b> This Project taught me vital skills about working in a team, as this was my first collaborative project - where I worked with just one other Games Artist, I stuck to handling the project itself and roughly prototyping the 
					mechanics ahead of time to get playtesting and feedback in. Once the feedback was received and people were happy I would go back and polish up these mechanics to make them more optimised, streamlined and user-friendly
					<br /><br /><b>Planning:</b> Crescent Cove also heavily emphasised the importance of a structurally sound plan from the beginning, as this project was the first project I had planned out this much and this proved beneficial as we
					had a clear vision from the beginning which made our next steps easier to follow, and this opened my eyes to the importance of planning.
